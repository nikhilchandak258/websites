This is a milestone year for ISAAC, having seen 14 years of success. IEEE-TSEC presents, for the first time in the history of TSEC, a mega blockbuster event, ISAAC NIGHT, commemorating the 15th year of ISAAC! We in IEEE-TSEC wish to share this proud moment with the youth of today by conducting ISAAC NIGHT. It will consist of a dazzling laser show where students will be enthralled by enigmatic effects of light, followed by a foot tapping DJ night, for students to rock the dance floor.
