ISAAC organizes workshops which are divided into the categories 
of robotics and non-robotics. Several workshops are conducted, where a 
massive turnout of enthusiastic students learn about computing, web designing, 
application development, and simple manufacture and programming of bots, among many other workshops. 
The workshops are highly technical and hence students gain tremendous knowledge about prominent technologies and concepts.
