Visual effects (commonly shortened to Visual F/X or VFX) are the various processes by which imagery is created and/or manipulated outside the context of a live action shoot. 
Visual effects involve the integration of live-action footage and generated imagery to create environments which look realistic, but would be dangerous, costly or simply impossible to capture on film.
