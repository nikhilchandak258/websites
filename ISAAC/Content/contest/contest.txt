Contests are for the tech geeks and aficionados who can’t
 wait to battle it out in the battlefield. They are high level 
technical robotic and non-robotic contests, where students learn and 
compete to win laurels and knowledge. It is truly a battleground for students 
to test their technical wits and merits against each other.
