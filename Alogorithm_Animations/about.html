<h2>1.1 Problem Statement</h2>
We present a visualization tool for the interactive learning of data structures and algorithmic schemes which can be used as a useful educational environment in Computer Science. The different parts of this tool intend to transmit to the students the importance of separating the specification and the implementation of data structures, facilitating the intuitive comprehension of the most typical implementations by using algorithmic schemes, and providing examples where such structures are used. The tool has been designed to allow teachers to monitor the whole educational process of the students, providing a personal training assistant and a range of tutoring techniques according to the student’s response.
<br /><br />
<h2>1.2 Scope of the Project</h2>
The application allows users to understand data structures and algorithm more easily and in a simplified manner. The user can select which data structure and algorithm is to be learnt from the given set of algorithms. Difficult algorithms can now be easily understood. With the huge potential in uses of data structures and algorithms, the applications of this system are extensive in the field of computer science.

<h2>1.3 Relevance Of Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Real-World Data Storage:</li>
By real-world data, we mean data that describes physical entities external to the computer. As some examples, a personnel record describes an actual human being, an inventory record describes an existing car part or grocery item, and a financial transaction record describes, say, an actual check written to pay the electric bill. A non-computer example of real-world data storage is a stack of 3-by-5 index cards. These cards can be used for a variety of purposes. If each card holds a person’s name, address, and phone number, the result is an address book. If each card holds the name, location, and value of a household possession, the result is a home inventory.
<br />
<li>Programmer’s Tools</li>
Not all data storage structures are used to store real-world data. Typically, real-world data is accessed more or less directly by a program’s user. Some data storage structures, however, are not meant to be accessed by the user, but by the program itself. A programmer uses such structures as tools to facilitate some other operation. Stacks, queues, and priority queues are often used in this way. We’ll see examples as we go along.
<br />
<li>Real-World Modelling</li>
Some data structures directly model real-world situations. The most important data structure of this type is the graph. You can use graphs to represent airline routes between cities or connections in an electric circuit or tasks in a project. Other data structures, such as stacks and queues, may also be used in simulations. A queue, for example, can model customers waiting in line at a bank or cars waiting at a toll booth.
